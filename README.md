# National ID Card Detection using TensorFlow

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting and extracting information from National ID Cards using TensorFlow. The project includes a character image dataset generator, a model for predicting characters, and a pipeline for inference using custom images.


## Components

### 1. Text Segmentation (Unfinished)

The text segmentation module is currently under development. This component aims to segment text regions in ID card images to extract relevant information.

### 2. Character Image Dataset Generator (Finished)

The `generate_dataset.py` script is responsible for creating a synthetic dataset of characters. It generates character images with various fonts, sizes, and backgrounds, providing diversity for training the character prediction model.

### 3. Character Prediction Model (Finished)

The `image_classification_model.h5` file contains the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to predict characters from images. It has been trained on the synthetic dataset generated by the dataset generator.

### 4. Inference Pipeline (Finished)

The `inference_pipeline.py` script demonstrates how to use the trained character prediction model to make predictions on custom ID card images.
